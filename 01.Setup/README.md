    - Windows Installer (.msi)	32-bit/64-bit
    - Windows Binary (.zip)	     32-bit/64-bit
    - macOS Installer (.pkg)	  64-bit
    - macOS Binary (.tar.gz)	  64-bit

    etc..

    > Note: For Windows/Mac the node installation alos intalls NPM. For Unix distributions, npm might have to be installed seperately.
